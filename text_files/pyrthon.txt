Daily lots of data is exchanged and loaded on a cloud into
different sectors one of which is the health sector. Data
exchanged between the patient and doctors need to be
secured to gain patients' trust. Blockchain is a mechanism
invented to secure data in a more advanced way. Blockchain
stores data into chunks that make it hard to decode, which
will help provide an extra layer of security. Hash chain is the
most reliable part of the blockchain that will help keep the
data unreadable. This data can be secured by using a
blockchain mechanism at the backend of any hospital
website to store the reports of the patients and maintain a
two-way authentication for doctorâ€™s access to the reports.
Using the concepts of dividing data into chunks and
establishing an inter-link between each chunk is one of the
aspects of blockchain which is implemented on the hospital
generated data to inherit blockchain mechanism. In this
paper, we have discussed the benefits of using this
mechanism to secure patients' reports and how it increases
trust in the stored data.
